Unmending Plus re-balances Mending Enchantment. In spite of its name, Unmending Plus is a minor addition to Txuritan's Unmending. Bug fix to be precise. Txuritan's Unmending (accidnetally) allows tools with Mending be repaired with XP Orbs. Unmending Plus tries to fix that.

Mending is great but Minecraft become boring once you obtain the best gears that never break. In order to "Make Minecraft Great Again", Unmending Plus does the following: 

### 1. Disables XP Orb Repair

XP Orbs can no longer repair tools with Mending.

### 2. Forbids Mending Be Applied as Enchantment

Mending Books cannot be applied to tools.

### 3. Mending Resets "Extra Repair Cost"

Because of "Too Expensive", tools become unrepairable after a certain point. This is where new Mending mechanics become useful. Mending Books can reset Extra Repair Cost when applied using Anvil.
